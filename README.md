forklift
--------
The POSIXÂ¹ shell concurrent stream processor!

Forklift reads from stdin and distributes each line of input among its worker pool.

    USAGE
    forklift [-w#] command

    EXAMPLES
    $ for d in {1..10};do echo $d;done | ./forklift 'xargs echo'
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

    # now concurrently with 2 workers
    $ for d in {1..10};do echo $d;done | ./forklift -w2 'xargs echo'
    2 4 6 8 10
    1 3 5 7 9

For more details on the rationale and implementation, see my blog [post](https://blog.dnmfarrell.com/post/parallel-processing-with-bash/).
